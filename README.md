# UdonToolbox

A collection of U# scripts that are easy to understand and use (for Udon worlds on "VR Chat"). 
For free use/modification allowed.

Check out latest version at.

In addition to the SDK3 with Udon, you will need U# for the code/scripts to work, download latest version from here.

Many of these are designed to function as the old trigger system from the SDK2, 
meaning the component for buttons/triggers/colliders may have to be on the same game object the script is on and that it need collider/trigger components (or other required).

------------ Please Note the following: ------------

Do not edit the code it self (updated versions will overwrite it).
If you want to modify the code then make a copy of it with a unique "class name" to edit instead.
If you do edit the code/copy of it, please make a note of this in the code (a simple edited/modified by "name" in the dev notes will suffice).
Updated versions might have new variable names (will be noted in the readme file if so), if this is the case you will have to redo the setup of said variable (sorry for the inconveniance).
All codes are provided as "work in progress" i try clear all bugs and test but some issues will slip by me.
If you want to credit the use of the toolbox feel free to do so (with link/adress to github provided).

Updated readme file will be provided for each release, please read for more details.
